You are doing great! 🌟
Remember to take deep breaths. 💙
Small steps are still steps forward. ✨
Be kind to yourself today. ☀️
You are stronger than you think. 🌈
You are enough just as you are.
This too shall pass.
You are stronger than you think.
Be kind to yourself today.
Progress, not perfection.
Your feelings are valid.
Take it one day at a time.
You are doing your best, and that is enough.
Breathe in courage, breathe out fear.
Small steps still move you forward.
Rest is productive too.
You deserve love and care.
It’s okay to ask for help.
Your mind is a garden — tend it gently.
Be proud of how far you’ve come.
Self-care is not selfish.
You are not alone.
You matter more than you know.
It’s okay to feel what you feel.
Give yourself permission to pause.
Healing is not linear.
You’ve survived 100% of your hardest days.
Trust yourself — you’ve got this.
Good things take time.
Be gentle with your heart.
Slow down and give yourself grace.
You can’t pour from an empty cup — rest.
One breath at a time.
Believe in your resilience.
You are worthy of good things.
Your story isn’t over yet.
Storms don’t last forever.
You’re allowed to take breaks.
Your best is enough.
Keep going — you are growing.
Peace begins with self-kindness.
Speak to yourself like you would to a friend.
You have done hard things before.
You are allowed to start over.
Celebrate small wins.
There is hope even on the darkest days.
You are more than your thoughts.
Trust the timing of your life.
Be here now.
You are a work in progress — and that’s beautiful.
